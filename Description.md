The website focuses on how to provide immediate help to the patients without having to bother about the authenticity and caliber of the doctors listed. Imagine a place online that is literally your mind palace. Man ki Shanti is exactly that app. If at any point in time you feel the need to vent out or even take inspiration from how well you have done the past few months or years, you have it in our own words.
The app features the following:
1.	Users make their accounts on the website by updating information like name, age, country, phone number and the mental health issue they are experiencing. 
2.	Once logged in, they can see the profiles of various certified professionals and doctors who can help them. 
3.	Because of the work from home arrangement and online activity, itâ€™s not possible to jot down your day on pen and paper daily. So, the users will have a provision to write their journals on our website and its privacy will be our concern. 
4.	Anyone can post advices, suggestions, concerns, questions, doubts etc. anonymously so that no one fears being cat-called and at the same time sharing these stuffs with those in need or who can help. 
5.	The Watson chatbot interacts promptly with those in trouble and need immediate help. This helps in catering to a greater number of people at a time and reduces the human efforts and errors involved during text interaction.
