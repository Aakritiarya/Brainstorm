## Short description

### What's the problem?

Because of the lockdown and social distancing situation, all of us are craving for the people with whom we had long drawn discussions over just a cup of tea. But for some of us, the issue is way more than that. Social contact helps us to cope with stress and major life changes and when this emotion doesn’t find a way out, it starts to affect our mental health. Taboo around mental health issues has been around for decades now but the times are changing and it’s changing fast. People have started accepting it and spreading the word of cognizance to those around them.

### How can technology help?

Since the boom of social networking sites, we all have found a way to stay in touch even with that 4th grade friend who we never talked to! Then why not use this as a tool to bring together people with mental health issues and help them fare through the tough times. Why not make the online world as fun and as warm as the one we share with our friends and families? 

### The idea

As Glenn Close said “What mental health needs is more sunlight, more candor and more unashamed conversations”. Hence, we try to bring our people an app that would help them have those candor conversations, a community without judgements and above all a community that understands. IBM has given us this opportunity to make an impact that matters by letting us harness its services like Watson

## Result

### Conclusion

With the increasing suicide cases because of poor mental health across the globe, such initiatives will help clear the stigma around it and will help in making our society a more welcoming one. 

### Future Scope

The website can further be enhanced by incorporating a section wherein videos and tutorials related to various calming activities like gardening, singing, painting, gaming etc. can put up and users can be asked for enrolling for any activity that soothes them down.
